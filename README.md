# DreamGame
Repository for a game featuring alternating gameplay in a day/night cycle, and an overarching detective narrative.  Players control a failed cop who is now a janitor in a police station.  Night time "dream sequences" feature multiple mini games being played simultaneously in different level layouts, each being controlled by a single keyboard key.  Day time gameplay will have players balancing trying to earn money each day, while also ear-hustling from nearby police officers about evidence for a high profile local case. 

The initial story scene was started in early June 2021.  This uses the ink dialogue system which can be found here https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/.
This story has now been nixed in favor of the above.  

The gameplay code was not started until mid July 2021.
